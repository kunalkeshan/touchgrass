# Daily Activity: How It's Measured

At Touch Grass, we understand the importance of consistency when it comes to building habits and achieving personal growth. That's why we've developed a unique feature to help you track your daily activity and stay accountable to your goals. In this article, we'll dive into how our Daily Activity feature works and how it can benefit you on your journey towards self-improvement.

## Understanding Daily Activity Status

When you create a new habit on Touch Grass, you're given the opportunity to track your daily activity for that habit. Each day, you'll have one of three possible statuses:

### Completed

If you successfully perform the habit for the day, you'll mark it as "completed." This status is represented by a green block on your activity graph, indicating that you've shown up and taken action towards your goal.

### Failed

If you're unable to perform the habit for the day, you'll mark it as "failed." This status is represented by a red block on your activity graph, signaling that you didn't meet your goal for that day.

### Missed

If you neither completed nor failed to perform the habit, it's marked as "missed." This status is represented by a gray block on your activity graph, indicating that you either forgot to update your progress or had some other personal reason for not completing the habit.

## Visualizing Your Consistency Over Time

The Daily Activity feature provides you with a visual representation of your consistency over time. By displaying your daily activity status in a graph format, you can easily see how often you're meeting your goals and identify patterns in your behavior.

### Hover Over Each Block for Details

To provide you with more context, you can hover over each block on the activity graph to view which day it represents. This allows you to track your progress with precision and understand your habits on a deeper level.

## Motivation to Keep the Streak Going

One of the key benefits of the Daily Activity feature is its ability to motivate you to keep the streak going. Seeing a long chain of green blocks can be incredibly rewarding and encouraging, serving as a visual proof of your dedication and consistency.
